# 🚀 AI Performance Analyzer

An AI-powered web application that analyzes a candidate’s **resume** and **hackathon participation proofs** to evaluate overall performance, visualize trends, and generate intelligent feedback.

Built with **Streamlit**, this project helps students understand where they stand and how to improve their hackathon and technical journey.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Students participate in multiple hackathons but rarely get structured feedback on:
- How their performance has evolved
- Whether their skills align with outcomes
- What they should improve next

This project bridges that gap using **AI + data visualization**.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Upload **Resume (PDF)**
- 🏆 Upload **Hackathon Certificates (PDF / JPG / PNG)**
- 🧩 Extract technical skills from resume using NLP
- 📊 Analyze hackathon outcomes (Winner / Finalist / Participation)
- 📈 Visualize performance trends across hackathons
- 🤖 Generate AI-based performance summary & recommendations
- 🌐 Deployed as a public web app using Streamlit

## 📠Working
1. The user uploads their resume in PDF format.
2. The system extracts technical skills from the resume.
3. The user uploads hackathon participation certificates (PDF or image).
4. Each certificate is analyzed to identify the level of achievement.
5. Hackathon results are converted into performance scores.
6. A graph is generated to show performance across hackathons.
7. An AI-based summary provides feedback and improvement suggestions.
